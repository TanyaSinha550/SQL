Approach 1

select max(salary) SecondHighestSalary from employee
where salary < (select max(salary) from employee)

Approach 2    ----- need to do distinct because there can be duplicates before that salary

select  (select salary from 
(select a.salary,row_number() over (order by a.salary desc) rn from (select distinct salary from employee)a)
tt where tt.rn=2)
SecondHighestSalary from dual

Approach 3

select (select distinct salary  from
(select salary,dense_rank() over (order by salary desc) dn from employee ) tt 
where tt.dn=2) 
SecondHighestSalary from dual


Approach 4 ---------> Best Way

select (select * from (select distinct salary from employee order by salary desc)
where rownum<=2
minus
select * from (select distinct salary from employee order by salary desc)
where rownum<=1 ) SecondHighestSalary  from dual


============ Not working on leetcode =============

select distinct salary from employees order by salary desc
offset 1 row fetch first 1 row only
