Write an SQL query that reports for each player and date, how many games played so far by the player. 
That is, the total number of games played by the player until that date.


select a1.player_id,a1.event_date,sum(a2.games_played) played_so_far from activity a1 inner join activity a2
on a1.player_id=a2.player_id
where a1.event_date >= a2.event_date
group by a1.player_id,a1.event_date
order by a1.player_id,a1.event_date asc
